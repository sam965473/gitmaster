# < This is step used to clone the remote repo to local repo to use it>

1) git clone "url link without"
2) cd .\dsadump (changing the directory to work)
3) ls
4) ls -a
5) git status (There are four status)
(status)
a) untracked (abhi just create hui hai)
b) modified (abhi unme kuch changes huwe hai)
c) staged (staging area mai pahuch chuki hai, commit hone ka wait kar rahi hai)
**Note** :- if you want to remove a file from commit area then just (git rem --cached a.txt) {here a.txt is the name of the file}
d) unmodified (koi bhi changes nhi huwe hai kisi bhi file mai)

6) git add . (adds new or changed files  in your working directory to the Git staging area " '.' means add all")
7) git commit -m "yaha p tera finally upload ho jayega" (it is the record of changes)
8) git push (upload local repo content to remote repo) {here from origin we are calling to the remote repo and in that repo we are refering to the main branch}





# < Now we are making a project in our local repo first then push it on the git>

1) cd .. (this help to get back from a directory)
2) mkdir name (this help to create a local folder on the local device)
Q) how do we know this not a repo right now?
A) we will only get two file (.  , ..) when we do ls
3) ccd name (here we will change the directory to the directory we maked using mkdir) 
4) git init (this will   create .git folder in the directory {basic init is use to create a new git repo})
-->> clear (it is just used to clear the mess)
5) git add .
6) git remote add origin <--link--> { origin can be replace with any name}
note:- we have to always check the our remote repo and branch, origin is the file original repo
7) git remote -v ( to verify remote)
8) git branch (to check branch)
9) git branch -M main  (to rename branch)

**only when the below steps are not working**
{
git add .
git commit -m "any message of your choice"
}
10) git push origin main  { we can also use git push -u origin main, to set it permanent to that we don't have to verify each time that on which repo and branch we are refering to while pushing. }
# < This are some steps to push any modification in real time >
{ now if you want to make a file then just use touch command (to make the file) , ls command to verify that the new file is added in the current directory and then use ( git add .) then use (git status) then (git commit -m "comments") then just pom(git push origin main {as main is our branch name}) then the file will be pushed in the repository on github.}

** Note ** :- a) if you want to remove a file from git staging area then "git rem --cached a.txt". 
              b) if you want to check the history then "git log".





# < Making changes in a repo and opening a pull request >
1) first click on fork, then create a new fork. (on github website).
2) git clone the repository on your system using (git clone <--link-->).
3) git add .
4) git commit -m "any comment"
5) git push origin main (pom kardo)
6) now go to the repository where you wanted to fork the changes and look for pull request in contribute
7) there should a open pull request, click on it.
8) create a pull request now.
9) add a discription and give it a name,,,  then "create pull request".
