git clone "url link without"
cd .\dsadump (changing the directory to work)
ls
ls -a
git status
(status)
untracked
modified
staged
unmodified

git add . (adds new or changed files  in your working directory to the Git staging area " '.' means add all")
git commit -m "yaha p tera finally upload ho jayega" (it is the record of changes)
git push (upload local repo content to remote repo) {here from origin we are calling to the remote repo and in that repo we are refering to the main branch}

 < now we are making a project in our local repo first then push it on the git>
cd .. (this help to get back from a directory)
mkdir name (this help to create a local folder on the local device)
Q) how do we know this not a repo right now?
A) we will only get two file (.  , ..) when we do ls
  
git init (this will   create .git folder in the directory {basic init is use to create a new git repo})
clear 
git add .
git remote add origin <--link--> { origin can be replace with any name}
git remote -v ( to verify remote)
git branch (to check branch)
git branch -M main  (to rename branch)

**only when the below steps are not working**{
git add .
git commit -m "any message of your choice"
git push origin main  { we can also use git push -u origin main, to set it permanent to that we don't have to verify each time that on which repo and branch we are refering to while pushing}
 
{ now if you want to make a file then just use touch command and then use ( git add .) then use (git status) then (git commit -m "comments") then just pom(git push origin main {as main is our branch name}) then the file will be pushed in the repository on github.}
